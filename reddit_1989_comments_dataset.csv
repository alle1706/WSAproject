Edit: To add, this album means so much to me because it came during a time when I first started to really listen to and appreciate music.

jvkhk3y,15n46ug,Taylor's Instagram Announcement for 1989 (Taylor's Version),"Let's not forget that her biggest hits to date Shake It Off and Blank Space are on this album! Her re-recording such iconic tracks which earned her so much success is very monumental. They're still being played to date on radio stations worldwide, so this is a very important album for her to re-record business wise. Speak Now, Red and Fearless were mostly nostalgic, but we've reached the point where the album with the largest commercial success to date is getting its re-release so best believe she is going to make it BIG. Yes, there's 'only' 5 Vault tracks but I think we should prepare for one or two very big featured artists and 2 or more singles and music videos. These tracks are a vital contribution to the sales of the album so she has to go all out, no skips. It's the most important re-recording she has to release.",3,fooledmeagain,2023-08-10 12:56:28

jvjutcz,15n3w98,1989 (Taylor‚Äôs Version) Announcement,"Okay so here‚Äôs something I‚Äôm really curious about. 

1989 was a big deal for her because it was the only era where she was all-pop and didn‚Äôt perform any non-pop songs, including her older country songs. (During the Reputation tour she played her country songs like Love Story, You Belong With Me and Should‚Äôve Said No with country-style production)

There are actually a lot of non-pop songs from the 1989 vault, but when she decided that she needed to make a sonically cohesive album she:

>decided that anything she wrote that sounded like 'Red' wouldn't make it onto the new album -- no matter how good it was.

[(Source)](https://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-on-going-country-to-pop/)

So I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äî do you think any of the non-pop songs from the vault are going to make it onto the re-record? Or do you think she‚Äôll solely stick to pop songs?",125,sleepyboi08,2023-08-10 08:16:47

Let's not forget that her biggest hits to date Shake It Off and Blank Space are on this album! Her re-recording such iconic tracks which earned her so much success is very monumental. They're still being played to date on radio stations worldwide, so this is a very important album for her to re-record business wise. Speak Now, Red and Fearless were mostly nostalgic, but we've reached the point where the album with the largest commercial success to date is getting its re-release so best believe she is going to make it BIG. Yes, there's 'only' 5 Vault tracks but I think we should prepare for one or two very big featured artists and 2 or more singles and music videos. These tracks are a vital contribution to the sales of the album so she has to go all out, no skips. It's the most important re-recording she has to release.",54,fooledmeagain,2023-08-10 13:03:02

My thoughts so far are:

\-THE COVER IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONE SO FAR she looks STUNNING and so happy, I love her so much and I'm so glad she's thriving. She deserves it.

\-ONLY 5 VAULT TRACKS??????? ONLY 5? 1989 deserved the Red treatment. They will be killer though, that's for sure.

\-Speak Now deserved better :( just a lil' bit more attention. She's such a middle child within the ""first half"" of Taylor's discography",50,anoceanview,2023-08-10 08:40:16

I've compiled a list of live performances of most of the hit singles from 1989 in order to (hopefully) change your mind if you dislike a single, as these performances made me see these songs in new ways and I hope you get that experience too.

TWAF was the only other previously released vault track that I know of. But, anyways, since we only have 5 vault tracks this time, I‚Äôm very cynical about getting TV‚Äôs for Sweeter than Fiction or the Kendrick remix.",19,-PepeArown-,2023-08-10 09:18:42

Now it‚Äôs 2023, and I‚Äôm 25, the same age Taylor was when she released this album that completely changed her life and transcended her to another level. It was everywhere, and I owned it on CD, and played it in my old AF used 2005 Subaru Forester that my family got me from a family friend when I passed my driver‚Äôs test.  In my own way I‚Äôm going through my own transformations and my life is obviously so different from where I was 10 years ago, just like Taylor, but it‚Äôs just so emotional seeing an album that defined my life at 15 being rereleased with so much more passion, love, and effort. I am so happy for her and proud of us for where we‚Äôve come from. Maybe that sounds parasocial, or maybe it is, but it‚Äôs just emotional to finally be here. This release will mean so much to me.

Also side note I am also very much looking  forward to hearing her version of many of these songs since it seems like the difference in her vocals were so evident in Speak Now (Taylor's Version).

jvjwgq6,15n3w98,1989 (Taylor‚Äôs Version) Announcement,"I‚Äôm so ready for pop Taylor to come back!! 

A couple random thoughts:

RIP to Bad Blood featuring Kendrick! I honestly thought she would re-record her #1 hit. 

I think the 5 vault tracks (never before heard) confirms Sweeter Than Fiction is not on this album which is honestly a good thing, it looks like this will have a much tighter tracklist. Red TV felt a bit bloated with Ronan, State Of Grace Acoustic, etc. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, beautiful songs, but I prefer no skips (I need to be in the mood for those). 21 is a great number of songs. 

Those limited edition CDs are 100% being turned into vinyl variants! I predicted this‚Ä¶ different polaroids as alternative covers!

This announcement will send Cruel Summer to #1 this week! That‚Äôs why she didn‚Äôt drop remixes or a music video or anything like that - because this announcement is all that she needed in order to send people rushing to her Spotify page and stream her hits. If she drops a vault song this Friday as a single with huge promo and sends that to #1 the following week, she‚Äôll repeat what she did during 1989‚Ä¶ replacing herself at #1 in back to back weeks! (Like when Blank Space replaced Shake It Off at #1)

I think the exclusion of Bad Blood with Kendrick, Sweeter Than Fiction, etc supports my idea that she‚Äôll release an ‚ÄúAcross The Eras‚Äù album at the end of the re-recording process, with all the loose ends like Only The Young, Eyes Open, Safe and Sound, maybe Carolina, All of the Girls, etc. Maybe even IDWLF‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not guaranteed to be on rep TV now!

I‚Äôm so curious to see if Max Martin will do the vault tracks. I doubt he did the standard re-records as he didn‚Äôt do Wildest Dreams or the pop songs on Red, but she said on Instagram that the vault songs are ‚Äúinsane‚Äù‚Ä¶ I feel like Max is needed to capture that 1989 magic again in the new vault songs. 

Willing to bet one of the vinyl variants will be clear with pink, to stop people from spending thousands on the RSD variant (which is good!)

So many thoughts but I‚Äôll end my essay here!!",28,dmnaf,2023-08-10 08:36:07

I was a sophomore in high school when the og album came out, I ran to Target after school to get the C.D, and then during the summer of that year, my swim instructor gave me a second 1989 C.D. And then a year later; I went to the Philly stop of the 1989 WT with my cousin and my dad while we lived there and it was incredible. Since then, it‚Äôs been the album to help me out on bad days. Every morning while i was in highschool, i would recite the ‚ÄúClean‚Äù speech in the mirror and then play the song as some type of meditation before school. So the fact that 9 years later I‚Äôll be in my senior year of college streaming this album from my speakers while finishing up my degree in journalism is gonna be so amazing because the thing that almost got me into journalism was that iconic Taylor Rolling Stone cover story in 2014 even before the 1989 era had even begun.

So Speak Now, 1989 and then new album"". But I just don't buy it. I seriously doubt she'd release a NEW album while still touring all her Eras + Lover, folklore, evermore and Midnights all for the first time.

My best guess right now is that Rep TV gets released OR at least announced in February to coincide with the Asian leg of the tour (+ Karma MV easter egg), and she ends with TS TV some time in the summer. Ending with the debut album feels right for two reasons: 1) being her first album and coming full circle, 2) it's likely to have the least amount of fanfare of any of the re-recordings.

That *might* be a good thing from her perspective if she's looking to release a new album in Q1/early Q2 of 2025 - it's not something she's ever done before, but the Christmas sales bump isn't like it was earlier in her career, so I could see her mixing it up if she doesn't want to wait until the fall.",23,AccordingRow8863,2023-08-10 15:43:58

jvloipy,15nbkkg,"Release Schedule Speculation for Remaining Re-records, TS11","A similar question was raised a week or so ago but there has been an announcement since then so it‚Äôs worth thinking again.

Just about everyone guessed/deduced that 1989 was coming in October and a lot of people were right about the actual date. So what happens next?

I do think Reputation TV will be announced after Christmas and released in the spring but I am less sure about TS11 than I was. Taylor has stuck to a two year album cycle except due to Kim and Covid but I do wonder whether she feels bound by that schedule any more.

There are so many things she can do outside of that and maybe she will throw some curve balls in among the legs of the Eras Tour that are left - which is actually nearly two thirds of it unless she announces yet more dates.

There is going to be a US tour film and I would be surprised if we don‚Äôt get that before the end of 2023. Taylor has also not done a behind the scenes documentary since January 2020 so there is a lot to catch up on. I would not be at all surprised if Lana Wilson does a sequel to Miss Americana including Folkmore, the re-recording and Midnights/Eras. 

We also have the feature film that will need to be shot and produced at some point and lots of people have talked about the theatrical nature of Eras. If Taylor wanted to do a Broadway show no one is going to object and she is a musical theatre girl by her own admission.

I do wonder whether TS11 might be fall 2025 rather than 2024 with a new tour in 2026 which is of course the 20th anniversary year of her first album.",7,culture_vulture_1961,2023-08-10 18:05:46

On the other hand, most people generally don't mind it at all and know that in many countries around the world, male and female names look the same.

jvsevqv,15okqzd,Remaining Taylor's version albums,I think it would be neat if Rep TV was announced on New Years Day 2024 and released on... April 29th!,25,Full-Surround,2023-08-11 23:32:28
jvszy4s,15okqzd,Remaining Taylor's version albums,"I don't want to wait this long, but Taylor's birthday is on a Friday next year which means December 13, 2024 would be a prime day to release Taylor Swift (Taylor's Version).",9,SnackieJackie,2023-08-12 01:57:39
jvsihta,15okqzd,Remaining Taylor's version albums,"I'm going more on location with some timing involved, mostly based on that she announced 'Speak Now' in Nashville and '1989' in LA. I could see her announcing the next one while she's touring Australia and then final album announced when she's performing in Wembley (2nd set of dates). With her schedule I can't see her not announcing the albums on stage, it's just too good of a moment.",4,vlarek,2023-08-11 23:56:01
jvsj8b4,15okqzd,Remaining Taylor's version albums,"The timing of the release of 1989 plus the unexpected add of additional North American dates really points to having a plan in place for the release of the remaining  two re-records and end the re-records along with the Eras tour and have that be an end to this chapter of her career.  

Now her first album gets so few streams there isn't financial pressure to release the re-record quickly so she could decide to release in a new album if she is completed in that spot in the second half of 2024, but I think that is unlikely.  If she hadn't added the additional North American shows then I think a new album would have been more likely in my opinion.",3,T44590A,2023-08-12 00:00:42
jvsl510,15okqzd,Remaining Taylor's version albums,"There was a lawsuit that prevented her from re-recording Reputation, wasn't there? Or something? If she could've done it quicker, I'm sure she'd have had all the TVs out relatively fast, but because she had to wait, she took a break to prepare for Midnights. Now that she's able to do them all, I think it'll be in fairly quick succession so she has a break before her next album again.

Plus, I'm sure she wants to have ""Taylor Swift"" be the last one, finish at the beginning. And as I've seen somebody on here say, it's her 'getting her name back' from Big Machine.

 She announced 1989 on the last show of the first US dates before going international, so she'll probably announce Rep TV at the final date of the year for a late January release then announce TS TV at her first date in Australia. Use the rest of the tour as promotion for all of them and Midnights then announce her next album at the final Eras date next November, for a late January release or possibly a quick release on the Friday before Christmas.",6,keving87,2023-08-12 00:13:25
jvt2tw9,15okqzd,Remaining Taylor's version albums,"I think it goes in two different ways:

1- Reputation in May/June with Debut Oct/Nov

I do struggle with the nostalgia now that we know what a difficult time she was having then. It‚Äôs hard to have fun watching the videos knowing she was starving herself trying to look perfect.

I was a fan before 1989, but it really ‚Äúhooked‚Äù me on her as an artist. To this day that album is my #2, second to Evermore.

As for not being relatable--1989 was a HUGE transition time for Taylor. I have a lot of admiration for it because I was a senior in high school, so that album was the soundtrack of my last summer before I went to college. I really saw that album as a 'I'm moving out on my own! I'm taking on the world with my friends!' She was in her midtwenties, no longer did she have the kid/disney gloves the record label put on her. 

I did not love red when it came out, I never listened to it. But when the re-release happened . . . suddenly I had life experiences to attach to those songs and that album (i.e my first real heartbreak).

6)1989 and Speak Now TV were tied up in legal issues for months. I highly suspect that she had planned to release one or both of them during that stretch.

She changed all the stuff on her socials back to midnights 

The bracelets blinking blue after last nights show (purple before) 

The new outfit for midnights has a super similar neckline to a 1989 outfit 

She only has one song left from 1989 as a surprise song possibility.

jvghjk5,15mewis,Is Taylor announcing 1989 Taylor‚Äôs Version tonight?,"Looking at it logically Eater eggs and the way Taylor's brain works aside. 1989 is her most successful album, it would make sense that she would want to own that asap. There have been time limits and I would say 1989 and Rep probably have the most production on them so probably took the longest to record.

We know some songs from 1989 have been done for a while. Hello Wildest Dreams, therefore if the production of the others songs was being finished it would make sense that going back to the way Taylor's brain works. She either release it on the 13th of a Month or 13th show/city which hasn't happened (yet) or when writing the date the American way on 8/9 on the 19th City of her tour.

Also the bracelets flashing blue so much, Gracie & Haim posting polaroid-esque pics this week and mentioning 1989 several times in their speeches on 8/3.

Two, since it is not really new music, the hype dies down quickly so there is no need to keep a long ""era"" for each re-recording.

On the other hand, Speak Now TV is still in the top 10 on the billboard 200 & Cruel Summer is rising on the hot 100.

2) The New York pap walks with her friends. And the New York pap walks of her alone in her white shirt + denim combo. 

3) Ending the 1st leg of her tour on 8/9 when most of it was weekend shows feels very deliberate. We have an entire song called Mastermind, I refuse to believe this was a coincidence. 

4) 1989 being almost wiped off the board completely in terms of the surprise songs, and the only song left on 1989 is New Romantics, a song about not giving a fuck, wearing heartbreak on your sleeve proudly, and being around people she loves and gives her joy. And it's still there while she's in a time of her life where she... went through heartbreak, faced criticism for choices good and bad, and is surrounded by thousands of fans. Too much of a parallel to not mean anything.

jvggx8u,15mewis,Is Taylor announcing 1989 Taylor‚Äôs Version tonight?,"These are all great reasons. 

From a business strategy perspective, I firmly believe she will have all the TV's out by the end of the Eras Tour. She seems to like to release every 6 months (the 2022 break/Midnights happened because legal issues were holding them all up). 

1989 and Speak Now have likely both been ready to go for quite some time, so there's really no reason not to have 1989 released in time for the Q4 holiday season.

jvgjna4,15mewis,Is Taylor announcing 1989 Taylor‚Äôs Version tonight?,"I agree. Plus, the HAIM sisters trolled us earlier this week using the TV New Romantics clip in a TikTok. I also like the additional unhinged things people have contributed to this clue narrative, such as the Karma music video hints: light blue vinyl in the opening, the 1989 roman numerals on her golden pedestal, video starts with 3 TS lightbulbs and ends frame with 5, and her blue polish finger nail next to the 8 on the clock latte. The latte especially has lived rent free in my head since the music video dropped. 

Personally, I hope she just drops the whole damn thing outright tonight. More realistically, I think she will just announce it tonight and drop it this Friday since she's a Friday girlie. However, 1989 is already a CRAZY successful album, and the TV will inevitably sit on the charts/streaming everyday for the rest of time, regardless of what day of the week she releases it. The original blank space and shake it off have dominated her streaming and 1989 hasn't left the Billboard Top 200 since...idk, 2017 when it re-entered? Announcing/dropping it now would also add vault tracks to the touring lineup, provide ample opportunity to pump out a shitload of Speak Now and 1989 specialty merch for the upcoming holiday season, and (possibly) keep this feral fandom fed through winter.",131,noteventhreeyears,2023-08-09 18:13:53

I was at the Nashville show that she announced speak now. She should have just released it. We don‚Äôt need weeks or months leading up the re records. They don‚Äôt need their entire own promo cycle.

I don‚Äôt know, I think Taylor‚Äôs done a lot to keep her fans happy and stay on top the past few years, balancing the release of Midnights along with the re-records and Eras tour. She also releases new music on each re-recorded albums so it feels like something extra as well as music videos. And then once this project is done, she‚Äôll probably move on to her next project, which could be more music or something else. 

It doesn‚Äôt feel the same as what Disney is doing with the live actions or the abundance of remakes. Taylor‚Äôs project has a goal and an eventual end date. We can cheer her on to the finish line. These remakes just never end.",4,chatterchick,2023-08-09 21:05:26

the music industry itself has a popular trend of sampling older pieces of music into current pop songs, Elton John comes to mind, as well as First Class, by Jack Harlow.

Disney is doing it for their movies, it‚Äôs the same thing, but they are a corporation so they are viewed differently and have different expectations.

The whole trend will eventually die, and people will begin to harp on individual acts for lacking creativity and new content the same way, people already believe Disney lacks new content. The writers/actors strike in Hollywood will likely increase the amount of re-used content as well and people will by dying for something new.

It's not confirmed though and people are divided about if its just a big fan or someone close to Taylor. Numptea has also not squashed any rumors. Lol.

jvgnpoo,15mewis,Is Taylor announcing 1989 Taylor‚Äôs Version tonight?,"several points to make here:

1. Elton John is a special case because his repurposed songs are super fresh and like brand new songs. I honestly didn't realize Cold Heart was made by mashing old songs together. Only Hold Me Closer was more obvious because Tiny Dancer is such an iconic song that is still super popular these days.

2. Sampling is not a trend. Jack Harlow using a sample for his song is the same as 3526282828 other musicians who have done before and will continue to do so every year.

3. Agree with the craving for fresh and new contents, but again, music cannot be compared to movies. A huge part of the criticism against these Disney remakes is how they changed shit around when no one asked (like casting regular sized actors for dwarves or a latina girl for Snow WHITE). Most people see these remakes as nothing but some desperate attempts to appeal for a certain demographic or a quick cash grab. I'm not gonna get into it because it's a whole political and cultural talk that's inappropriate for this discussion. Meanwhile, everyone is aware of why Taylor is re-recording her old albums, her albums are faithful to the original while still bringing in new songs to generate excitement. Her re-recordings absolutely CANNOT be compared to the remake trend in movies - which has been there before and will continue to be here long after she's done with the re-recordings.

4. There are always fresh and original music around. Taylor is not the monopoly in music. She's never gonna be the first to give the audience original and new music because there are literally a gazillion of original and new songs being released every day.",48,perryduff,2023-08-09 18:38:15
jvhm6p7,15mewis,Is Taylor announcing 1989 Taylor‚Äôs Version tonight?,"These are good points that I hadn‚Äôt fully considered about our current moment. 

I think the fact that Taylor is doing this project as a way to rage against Big Machine shields her now and in the future from criticism like this. Maybe not fully, but enough. Taylor‚Äôs going to be constantly releasing during a content drought over the next 12-18 months, I think that will benefit her. 

I agree though that it‚Äôs better to ride the success of the eras tour to get all the TVs out and then move on to whatever her next thing is.

Fun fact, did you know that Anthony Hopkins (aka Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs among many other roles) was diagnosed with autism in his 70s? Also the voice actor for Fry in Futurama is AuDHD too. 

Honestly, if you think about it, it makes sense. In order to be seen as creative or talented you have to have different thoughts and ideas than most other people. Neurodivergence is literally defined by having your brain work differently. I hate how offended people get sometimes when you suggest a famous person might be autistic.

I know it's an unpopular opinion but that was the worst marketing of a deluxe exclusive for any of her albums.

Then I woke up a little more and looked at it a little more closely and this is massively better than that was. They're four sets clearly labeled, not real blind bags, so for the collect-them-all collectors (of which I know the fandom has a number) they can just buy a set of four and be done. I do wish the covers, at least, were revealed in advance for the collect-your-fave physical collectors like me, but I get the reasoning behind it being a tease instead. (I don't particularly *like* it, but I don't like a lot of marketing. I *get* it. Marketing teams gonna market in effective ways.)

jvn3004,15n43lq,1989 deluxe CDs with Polaroids,"Just mentioning here for anyone on the fence since I feel like the description and marketing photos might be a bit misleading for ppl who are considering just quickly clicking buy.

"" **Each set includes 5 unique double-sided Collectible Photo Cards with 15 never-before-seen photos and lyrics from The Vault** ""

&#x200B;

* Basically it's just 5 cards that have a photo on the font/back + a lyric not 15 photos. For reference the original 1989 album each came with 13 photos + a lyric so if you will  '26 never-before-seen photos and lyrics!'
* I guess printing double sided was cheaper but for those who intend to display these it means you can only use half of the photos (not to mention if the backs look different and then for aesthetics you need to decide on hanging up all front or back images)
* The photos are not 8x10s or taller than the album like it appears and look to be the same small portrait size as the original photos included with 1989 due to the envelope size.

Personally I think I'll just grab the standard vinyl since the standard Speak Now marble violet never returned after selling out and I don't want to be forced into having a variant. Good look however you choose to support 1989TV!",2,folkleric,2023-08-10 23:07:53

jx7fkho,15n43lq,1989 deluxe CDs with Polaroids,"I‚Äôll be completely honest, I feel so stupid and high key sad.

I thought the placeholder photo was the actual cover and was obsessed with the simplicity of it all. Like it‚Äôs the exact opposite of all the other TV covers (Fearless, Red, and SN being just photo, no text). So I bought the crystal blue skies version and now that I see it‚Äôs just the normal cover (which I still ABSOLUTELY love), it makes me regret getting it since I bought the vinyl as well. 
 
The only excitement I have for its arrival is if I get I ‚ÄúClean‚Äù Polaroid. My attachment to 1989 when it originally dropped is heavily attributed to my love for Imogen Heap. She was the bridge to how I became a Swiftie. Also, ‚ÄúSparks‚Äù by Imogen Heap was my first and only CD I‚Äôve ever bought until now so it‚Äôs all a full circle for me anywaaaaaays, buuuuuut‚Ä¶

TL;DR, I‚Äôm really sad that the deluxe covers aren‚Äôt just the text, but I‚Äôm still excited for the Polaroids and am praaaying I get a clean one!

With that being said, I‚Äôm potentially willing to trade either CD‚Äôs and/or Polaroids when everyone gets theirs~",1,Sserrrphin,2023-08-22 02:07:51

jvmgj9g,15n43lq,1989 deluxe CDs with Polaroids,"What you've gotta know about Taylor is that she's very motivated by external accomplishments like awards and record-breaking and she genuinely enjoys business strategy. It's not really about money so much as she cares about ""winning"" and being business savvy. Her first love has always been her career. She even said when she was a literal teenager that she wouldn't be interested in a man that wasn't as fascinating as her career. She said that if she wasn't a musician she'd have gone into marketing.

It's definitely kind of problematic but she is who she is. It is contradictory to her values but I'm not sure that she entirely understands that ""successful at capitalism"" and ""caring about people"" are at odds. Some people have speculated that this somewhat disingenuous endless parade of ""limited"" edition physical media is mostly her label's doing. I think it's probably both.

And there are quite a few collectors. If you go to r/TaylorSwiftVinyl you'll see how much there is to collect.

I probably would have bought the Polaroids if they were sold extra too (with no CD/vinyl attached to it), but originally her Polaroids were sold with the one deluxe CD so it makes sense.

I do think there will be collabs as this has been a common denominator in all of her TV releases. As to who will be featured, I‚Äôm guessing names that were relevant in her life/the charts back in 2014. Just like Fall Out Boy and Hayley (Paramore) were very 2010-core. Katy Perry would be pretty epic and symbolic regarding their feud back then (Bad Blood debacle). Since Selena started in the Bad Blood video I could see her appear as well. So hot take: Katy, Harry and Selena. Wild guess: Imagine Dragons. They already performed together and Dan Reynolds did a Blank Space cover. They were becoming a big name in 2014/2015 so could also see that happen.",29,fooledmeagain,2023-08-10 09:36:48

I am 100% behind not supporting shitheads like Chris Brown who have actually harmed women or even assholes like Scooter who are using their influence to screw other artists over. 

But let's be honest, Matty's worst crime is he's made some poor taste jokes and has a habit of putting his foot in his mouth. He's not out here harming anyone beyond being somewhat obnoxious. 

You can choose not to like him but I don't think people should be shamed or be told they're ""giving Swifties a bad name"" for enjoying his music. That's the exact kind of virtue signaling I'm referring to.",14,Fact0ry0fSadness,2023-08-10 21:53:07

jvrpb6a,15o9vcn,Was there any actual significance to the color light blue during 1989‚Äôs era?,"I never personally saw 1989 as light blue since the cover was always saturated with a tint, so I always saw the album as yellow/beige and especially white because I remember that Taylor was dressed more in white and had those white sunglasses in promo photos. And her white two-piece costume with the black thigh-high boots for the tour is often used by fans to create eras art.

&#x200B;

But to its credit, the ""1989 World Tour"" did have white/pink/light blue font colors and if you google image search it, blue/light blue does come a lot on the first searches especially in the background stage design/lighting/costumes for singers and dancers, and the Shake It Off finale costume was often blue too. And like others mentioned, the ""Out of the Woods"" transitioning into ""Look What You Made Me Do"" blue dress was probably a big factor now too.",8,ChuChuRocketeer,2023-08-11 20:56:19

jvqj2tz,15o9vcn,Was there any actual significance to the color light blue during 1989‚Äôs era?,It mostly the colors she uses on the album covers and you associate the color with that album. Blue for 1989  is her shirt is Sky blue and the sky is blue. So it‚Äôs more of a sky blue and midnights is a midnight darker blue. Then a greenish Teal is more Debut. There‚Äôs a whole science of colors and associations including meanings. Taylor goes into the deeper explanations of some in her songs Red and most recently Maroon. It interesting stuff.,11,Rdickins1,2023-08-11 16:39:45

jvs3s50,15o9vcn,Was there any actual significance to the color light blue during 1989‚Äôs era?,"In my head, 1989 was a very summery album. The memorable outfits for me from that era are the dresses and crop top/skirt combinations. My brain assigns 4 of her albums seasons: Fearless (Spring), Speak Now (Winter), Red (Autumn) and 1989 (summer). I didn‚Äôt really assign 1 colour palette to associate with 1989 as she wore a hugeeee amount of colours but light blue makes sense to me as a summer colour.

TaylorSwiftStyle on instagram made a connection between her Era‚Äôs tour light blue outfits and her OOTW dress. I also thought of that as well. Taylor Swift herself used her OOTW dress to signify the end of her 1989 era in LWYMMD video so I feel that‚Äôs where a lot of Swifties find the association between 1989 and light blue. 

I personally hadn‚Äôt really assigned colours to her different eras until she started promoting Midnights and Eras tour. It made a lot of sense to me the colours that were being used for each era.",2,Responsible_Cloud_92,2023-08-11 22:23:31

jvsep37,15o9vcn,Was there any actual significance to the color light blue during 1989‚Äôs era?,"Yes, I guess 1989 was always associated to the ocean  and in the music video for Out Of The Woods she is wearing a light blue dress and I think that recently led to the album being associated to the color light blue.

But for me, the album color was always more light purpelish like the color of the OG cover and not light blue. Maybe it was also white especially due to that iconic outfit she wore for the 1989 tour, but light blue was never the color I associated it with, so I also feel like light blue was associated to that era recently. I also noticed like the album is much more associated to the ocean recently than it originally was, I always rather associated it to the big city life in New York City.

Because of that, it was widely believed 1989 (TV) would at least be announced in August (the 8th month of the year).

But now that her number of listeners is increasing rapidly and hype around her tour is out there, I am betting more people are going to watch and love her Rep tour video far more than 1989. And as most of us know, love for Reputation grows far faster once seen performed live. With the exception of Vigilante Shit and Cruel Summer, the most common viral clips I see of her tour are ALL from her Rep set, NOT from 1989.

They're not comparable in nature. The release of the LWYMMD MV and even just Reputation as an era was..... SO different from anything I've ever experienced with music. I've just *never* seen anyone do something like that before. She had people scouring her MVs for references to her ""enemies"", and the MV for LWYMMD (which she had the gall to premier live AT the MTV music awards) broke the record for most watched video in a 24-hour time afterwards, with just short of 44 million views(?) or something like that. Almost a 3rd or twice as many views as the record-holder before her? Something like that, I'd have to look it up.

jw1mspe,15pyprd,Taylor Swift‚Äôs ‚Äò1989 (Taylor‚Äôs Version)‚Äô Could Be Her Biggest Re-Recording Yet,"Your points are completely accurate and valid but I believe we are talking about very different types of comebacks. I'm talking from the ashes, burnt bridges, social pariah career comeback. The artists you brought up went on typical hiatus', they didn't have their careers destroyed overnight.
And I would argue that it was widespread knowledge that Taylor went missing, and the news coverage all over the media was that her career was ""over"". Everyone I spoke to (regarding music) knew what had happened at least to a minimal degree, because whether or not someone listens to her music, Taylor is one of the most well-known public figures in the media. (Very few of my acquaintances listen to TS in more than a casual, ""listen to it while it's on the radio"" way).

When I say it was the biggest comeback, it's because very few people can go through as big of a scandal as that and not only take back their career, but surpass all expectations and outperform what their career was before the scandal took place. She literally rose from the ashes. All this being said, my comment for it being the biggest comeback was not my reasoning for why RepTV could potentially outperform 1989TV. It was meant as more of a playful comment. 

I could get nore into RepTVs potential that but I think I'll include it as a separate post, since really I was just originally commenting on her huge comeback.",-6,mermaidthebanshee,2023-08-13 21:56:41

jw2dugl,15pyprd,Taylor Swift‚Äôs ‚Äò1989 (Taylor‚Äôs Version)‚Äô Could Be Her Biggest Re-Recording Yet,"Not who you are conversing with, but Taylor absolutely had a comeback album...Folklore. Taylor's reputation took such a hit after 1989, and while Rep and Lover did fine, numbers wise, for anyone who isn't Taylor Swift, they were nowhere in the same realm of success as Fearless or 1989, and it wasn't cool for her peers to acknowledge her, even. Remember that awful Lorde interview?  it wasn't until Folklore that Taylor rebirthed herself, and garnered widespread audience and critical acclaim again. If it wasn't for Folklore, we wouldn't have the Eras tour. I said what I said.",10,Phoenyxoldgoat,2023-08-14 00:55:14

But, 1989 is not a very melancholic album, so i doubt i will like the features as much (assuming there are any). The poppy and energetic duets never land for me. Karma, me, electric touch, etc.

I think that's probably why the collab aspect of it doesn't mesh for me most of the time. I like a collab if it's intentionally different perspectives, or some kind of call and response - so yeah, The Last Time and Exile are fantastic. Like Hayley sounds great on Castles Crumbling but that could've been a solo song. Others like IBYTAM and You All Over Me weren't even really collabs.

So yeah if someone like Harry wrote a romantic duet with her back in the day, I could enjoy it! Otherwise, it might not make sense to shoehorn his vocals into a random track that she wrote for herself.",1,savannahkellen,2023-08-15 20:22:01

jvo7w7a,15nsdo9,Vault Tracks: can someone ELI5??,"the process of making art is a very complex one. you start with a hundred ideas and the true test of your skill is how you narrow them down to convey a multitude of emotions and topics with minimal output. and in this process some really good works get left out of the final roster, some are merged to form something new.

the vault tracks are the ones Taylor had to omit from her albums for many different reasons. an album needs to be cohesive. for example, many people have been saying that ‚Äúoh I Can See You doesn‚Äôt sound like Speak Now Taylor at all‚Äù. well duh, that‚Äôs the reason it was left out. 

the rerecords are Taylor‚Äôs middle finger to the industry. she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about any red tape stuff and is basically a kid with too much sugar in her system, bouncing off the walls. chaos mode.

edit to add- even with this unrestricted freedom she isn‚Äôt going to put every single song she ever made on the album. those are a part of her creative process that allow her to improve her style. only the best stuff gets put out.",8,queeniepersephone,2023-08-11 03:47:06

jvnvawa,15nsdo9,Vault Tracks: can someone ELI5??,"I think it is possible she will release most vaut tracks in the future some day, but not on the re records. Firstly, she has far too many. It is rumoured she wrote over 150 songs for 1989, and I imagine more for debut because she was writing songs since she was a child. Secondly, they are primarily supposed to be like the original album. The vault tracks take away from that. Thirdly, they didn't make them onto the original album for one Reason or another, so lots of them aren't very good songs.",9,fferbbou,2023-08-11 02:17:53
jvnyy62,15nsdo9,Vault Tracks: can someone ELI5??,"Quality > quantity. Several of the Fearless TV vault tracks are forgettable or rehash something she wrote about in a better song. I'd also argue that there's a reason a few of the SNTV vault tracks were left off too, but that's more opinion based. She doesn't want to release songs that are subpar or will be disliked by the fans. 

She's also still needs to fit them onto physical media. You can only fit about 6 songs or so on a side of a vinyl record. Red TV had four LPs. Speak Now and Fearless TV had 3 each. If she released 20 vault songs for each album, it would lead to like 6x LP or 4 CDs for each album.",10,evergreen_pines,2023-08-11 02:43:38

jvpib3i,15nsdo9,Vault Tracks: can someone ELI5??,"Quality over quantity any time, and I think that‚Äôs what she thinks as well. The thing with 1989 Vault is that she has openly spoken about having written 100+ tracks for this album. So my delusional self always believed she would go all out with the TV and make it her biggest album to date by adding like 10+ new tracks. I‚Äôm sure the 5 that made the cut are going to be worth it but it would‚Äôve been quite a cool move to just turn it into a 2 hour long album. 

Don‚Äôt like to mention him but Chris Brown‚Äôs latest records have been 2,5 hours on average. Taylor doing something similar would‚Äôve been quite an iconic stunt and 1989 TV would‚Äôve lend itself perfectly for that imo.

In the week leading up to the announcement, streams for the LP had hovered around 6 million per day; they then jumped to over 14 million on Thursday after Swift broke the news.

>The album ‚Äî set for release Oct. 27, exactly nine years after the original *1989* dropped ‚Äî will be the fourth in Swift‚Äôs re-recording project. *Taylor‚Äôs Version* is the pop star‚Äôs response to Scooter Braun‚Äôs acquisition of the masters to her first six albums, after he purchased her old label Big Machine in 2019.

>The *1989 (Taylor‚Äôs Version)* announcement came as Swift wrapped the opening North American leg of her Eras Tour, which is on pace to be one of the most successful concert tours of all time.

I've been following her since 2008, but this is the album where I started to pay full attention to her and turned 100% stan. It's the one I love the most. [Style](https://youtu.be/-CmadmM5cOk?t=155) is my favorite Tay song ever. This album also came during one of the best moments of my life when I transitioned from being a teenager to an adult. I remember this as my *Coming-Of-Age* album. I truly hope she receives significant promotion for this one. This is going to be Major. Hope we get more than 1 video for this one.

If she's releasing only a small number of Vault Tracks, it's likely because they are of very high quality. She was a perfectionist with this record, wanting only the best content, as this album holds great importance. Im so excited. Wanna cry lol.",110,HausOfMajora,2023-08-10 08:44:31

Even with a dip of following the massive numbers of each album beforehand, those are numbers only she could really achieve.

I‚Äôd argue it was even slightly a step up considering Reputation really only had one last hit in Delicate. (Now whether the Lover singles have stuck around in public consciousness is another story) Overall, it‚Äôs not her best album but certainly not the flop some people make it out to be.

Rep was released in 2017. Lover, 2019. Folkmore was released in 2020, during a pandemic where there was a lot of time to write music. Midnights was released in 2022. 

Taylor *does* generally stick to a 2 year album cycle because that‚Äôs how long it takes while touring etc to create an album. 

The re-records are not the same as making a whole album out of thin air. It‚Äôs like writing a novel vs typing it back out again, there might be some changes and it takes a while but nowhere near as long as writing the book in the first place.

jvuvots,15om1d0,why are online sales now usually limited to the store's own country?,Sometimes a retailer will have an agreement that lets them be the exclusive (or be only one of a few) seller in their country. So they don't want to be undercut by retailers from other countries (and vice versa) so they are only able to ship to local addresses,3,BronzeErupt,2023-08-12 13:24:29

I would be so so surprised if it happened. I don't think newer Swifties understand the  obsession gossip rags and fans had with Haylor back in the day. Any collab here would bring that back to life a hundredfold and completely overshadow the recorded album. They would talk about nothing else, because Taylor and Harry have both only become bigger stars since then (which is crazy). Taylor knows that. She has struggled with people paying more attention to the gossip about her love life than to her music -- why would she do this? 

Harry too dislikes the attention given to his love life so I'd hope he'd nix the idea, even if Taylor wanted it. Why would he want to revive Haylor rumors, when it's not even his album and he gets nothing out of it? He's been very gracious and polite when asked about Taylor in the past, but you can tell he'd rather not talk about it. He'd never hear the end of it if he did this.",50,HuckleberryOwn647,2023-08-10 16:01:43

So does it matter that in the cafe chair burlesque routine for ""Vigilante _"" a homage to louche Bob Fosse dances, she's imprecise and physically uncommitted to the pleasures and dangers of sex? (She caresses her body like she's afraid to.)

I‚Äôve been to the eras tour and have also seen a ton of videos online/live streams etc. and this is just‚Ä¶not true? What does ‚Äúphysically uncommitted to the pleasures and dangers of sex‚Äù even mean? Taylor may not have the perfect rhythm and dance skills of a natural born dancer but if she has anything it‚Äôs the confidence to go through with the dance and moves like she owns the place. She commands attention which is what makes up for all of it. Her sexy dance doesn‚Äôt look awkward at all to me, she looks really self assured. Maybe they‚Äôre referring to her sometimes making a shocked face? That‚Äôs part of the performance since it‚Äôs playing with the fans who generally aren‚Äôt used to a performance like this from her (I know I was shook when I went to my show). Idk after I read that part I wondered if this critic was just putting in meaning that wasn‚Äôt really there.

Taylor is a non dancer who has a good choreographer who makes routines that work with her skill set, and a 17 year career of working on her skills combined with having natural stage presence has made it so that her dancing is perfectly fine for her show. She doesn‚Äôt look at all awkward to me because she‚Äôs not doing anything outside her comfort range or skill level. That‚Äôs it.",129,cookieaddictions,2023-08-12 17:19:07

Edit; also, I‚Äôm gonna say it. The reason so many articles are talking about *how remarkable* Taylor Swift is is because she‚Äôs the opposite. Average.

This criticism and discussion didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. It is not merely a byproduct of misogyny. Taylor‚Äôs marketing is aggressive and active, which generates discussion regarding her.

All the think pieces that use people commenting on her love life as an example of misogyny against her drive me nuts because writing about, teasing and leaving easter egg clues about her famous exes is why she started selling albums at that rate in the first place.

1989 era was ALL about Polaroids - it‚Äôs meant to replicate someone writing the title over a Polaroid and is a nice little call back to the OG cover.

I mean I love OOTW but the pop songs on red (taylor's version) were mixed badly especially I knew you were trouble , there's a huge chance he's gonna fuck up wonderland and I'm not prepared to see it",8,No_Barber4339,2023-08-10 19:11:59
jvoehw2,15n3zq6,Taylor Swift to release '1989 (Taylor's Version)' on October 27,"I said else where that she's basically recording two a year, but I've always had this feeling that she did everything in a few months and is just sitting on them. All the stuff pics of her heading in and out of the studio is just her going in and making sure that everything sounds good. She's probably not even doing anything. I get that studio time is booked in blocks, but she isn't getting that much done in an hour.",2,jarrettbrown,2023-08-11 04:34:44

jvlfv2e,15n3zq6,Taylor Swift to release '1989 (Taylor's Version)' on October 27,"To me Lover and Folklore are two different kind of summer albums, like Lover is happy, bright, it's hot and sunny and you're up to shenanigans and stay out late with your friends/partner and it's just optimistic.
Folklore is the rainy kind of summer, you spent time alone or with the people closest to you, take walks in the nature or stay at home and drink coffee/tea while watching thunderstorms, overthink and it's a bit melancholic. I love both, it's just a different kind of vibe",6,HazelTheHappyHippo,2023-08-10 17:12:57
