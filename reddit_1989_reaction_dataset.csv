15o3he9,I tried to edit cover of the 1989 (Taylor's Version) album.,"I'm not quite satisfied with this album cover, maybe because I studied art or had high expectations for it. üò≠ The original 1989 cover, with its unique charm, is something I really love. Taylor Swift's return to remake the chords got me really excited, but honestly, I think having a logo on the album cover is fine, just not placed at the top. It takes away the focal point of the image. So, I tried to customize it a bit. However, the essence is still true - the original cover is always better. It's a version of Taylor, and that's what matters most.

15n4dxv,Next Week's Taylor Swift Trivia Game & 1989 (Taylor's Version) Impending Release,"Edit: I've just found out that the album drops in October so this question is now completely irrelevant. Leaving it though as I'm not a fan of dirty deletes.

~~Hey folks, hoping to take the pulse of the fandom on something.~~

~~I regularly do Taylor Swift themed trivia events in my area, the next one is Wednesday next week. The game is built and ready to go and includes multimedia elements including album covers of original yet to be released TVs and TVs as released. Thankfully I started work on this game after Speak Now TV was released and so was able to ensure all multimedia was only TV content.~~

~~The issue I have is of course the impending release (by the look of it) of 1989 TV. To be honest, I'd prefer not to go back and re-edit the game I've already built but only if the general feeling will be that it won't be an issue for fans in the room. Of course, there's no way to be sure and so I'm looking to see if there is any kind of general consensus that immerges in replies.~~

~~Do I need to allocate time to go back and rebuild parts of my game or is it fine to run as is?~~

~~I think my biggest concern will be if something I use is sonically changed in the TV to the extent where it will be really obvious. The line change in Better Than Revenge is a good example of this.~~",9,0,0.91,2023-08-10 08:34:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15n4dxv/next_weeks_taylor_swift_trivia_game_1989_taylors/,scorpiousdelectus,Discussion :taythink:

Then I remembered that back in 2014 the standard edition of the cd did not have the title written on the picture, while the deluxe had the signature 1989 written with the sharpie on it.

15nbkkg,"Release Schedule Speculation for Remaining Re-records, TS11","Based on what we know about Taylor's album release schedule over the last year or so and the remainder of the Eras Tour schedule, I think we might be able to piece together a general idea of what the release schedule may look like for Debut TV/Rep TV/TS11...

# What We Know Album Timelines:

* *Midnights*
   * Announced: August 28
   * Released: October 21
* *Speak Now (Taylor's Version)*
   * Announced: May 5
   * Released: July 7
* *1989 (Taylor's Version)*
   * Announced: August 9
   * Released: October 27

# What We Know About Tour Timeline:

|*NA Leg*|*Break*|*SA Leg*|*Break*|*Asia, Oceania Leg*|*Break*|*EU Leg*|*Break*|*NA Leg 2*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mar - Aug 23|Sep - Oct 23|Nov 2023|Dec 23 - Jan 24|Feb - Mar 24|Apr 2024|May - Aug 24|Sep 2024|Oct - Nov 24|

# What This All Might Mean:

Given the information above, we can make some educated guesses as to when the next releases will come out...

* Re-record #1
   * Announcement: Spring 2024
   * Release: Summer 2024
   * Notes: This gives 1989 TV its moment in the sun, since it was such a pivotal album in her career, and allows her to highlight it during the SA/Asia/Oceania dates. Essentially, this also fits in with the timing of her release for SNTV in 2023.
* Re-record #2
   * Announcement: Summer 2024
   * Release: Fall 2024
   * Notes: This allows re-record #1 to be featured during the European leg of the tour while also having the added excitement of announcing the final re-record. Re-record #2 is then featured during the final North American leg of the tour. This coincides with her tendency to release albums in the Fall to capitalize on holiday sales, etc.
* TS 11
   * Announcement: Summer 2025
   * Release: Fall 2025
   * Notes: Reset, refresh, reload. After the conclusion of the Eras Tour, Taylor rightfully takes some time to rest those vocal cords for half a year or so after the tremendous success of the Eras Tour. During this time, she can put the finishing touches on TS11 and get ready for her next world conquest, as we know Blondie never rests for too long. Again, this fits her fall release tendency.

&#x200B;

As to which re-record comes first, that is anyone's guess at this point. To me, I think it would be a fitting end to the ""Eras Era"" to circle back to Debut as the final re-record and give Rep its moment in the sun in Europe, but that's just me.

What does everyone else think? I'd love to hear what others think about this timeline or any other in the comments!",65,55,0.98,2023-08-10 14:46:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15nbkkg/release_schedule_speculation_for_remaining/,bubblecuffer13,Discussion :taythink:
15pxob3,My local bookstore has set up a Taylor Swift inspired display of books!,"Hey everyone!

This is my first time posting on Reddit. Please excuse my English as it is not my first language. Also, I apologize in advance for the length of this post, as I have obviously wrote more than I wanted to even though I didn't intend to do that.

I'm a huge swiftie and a bookworm at the same time. So you can imagine my surprise and excitement when my friend and I found out that our local bookstore had set up a display of Taylor Swift-inspired books! To be specific, each book is specifically assigned to one of Taylor's lyrics, so people can choose a book according to their favorite lyric!

There was also a message attached to the rack (second picture) that said ""Take the friendship bracelets (at checkout)"". As it turned out, if you actually picked and bought a book from that collection, you could choose one Taylor-inspired friendship bracelet, which presumably the staff member made herself (yes I checked and it was a her)! So sweet, right? So I did so, and ended up picking the ""Blank Space"" bracelet to honor the newly announced 1989 (TV)! You can see that one in the very last picture.

This is one of the branches of our town of the large Slovak chain of bookstores ""Martinus"". Here in Slovakia, it's basically like your guys' Barnes & Noble - in short, very popular and widespread, but also quite generic. Martinus bookstores, however, usually always have one section dedicated to ""Recommended by Martinus staff"" (as you can see in the first picture at the very top - in Slovak it's ""Martinus√°ci odpor√∫ƒçaj√∫""). Honestly, until now I didn't care about it at all and thought that it was actually always just determined by the editorial team in their headquarters and that this section is the same at every branch. Apparently that's not the case, though, because this ""Martinus (Taylor's Version)"" collection is exclusive to our branch!

In short, after our group of 4 couldn't get tickets for The Eras Tour in Vienna, this came in handy. And given that our town has only 77,000 inhabitants, the chances of a swiftie working in our exact bookstore must have been really low. Especially when not many people in Slovakia know about Taylor in general, let alone be explicitly her fans.

15o6anw,Conflicted about 1989 era nostalgia,"Can I pre phrase this by saying I am a huge Swiftie, love the music on 1989 and never once hated Taylor. I actually love every one of her albums and now struggle to have a favourite (Speak now probably tied with Midnights) 

Okay, so. I became a fan during Debut with Tim Mcgraw, our song, and tear drops on my guitar being the songs that made me a fan. Fearless and Red hold a very special place in my heart as I listened to them so much throughout my teenage years, specially during hard times. Speak now, for some reason I sort of slept on but once I discovered it I instantly regretted missing out when it was originally released. 

Now, 1989 happened during a big transition in my life but when I heard the singles I initially felt a little dissapointed because the Taylor I loved from Fearless and Red sounded so different and had gone full pop. Then when I saw how she had changed her look, gotten a ""girl squad"" and basically became the ""It girl"" i felt like I lost the relatability to her, I never hated on her but took a step back. Once tabloid drama started happening I just didn't engage and again, stayed a step back as was a bit overwhelming and confusing as this wasn't the Taylor I had originally connected with. 

Lover album got me back into full Swiftie mode and I love 1989 and reputation, never looked back. I have actually related to her so much more now as I am similar age and over the last 5 years she's helped me in so many ways! 

I actually regret missing out back then but because of it, I'm finding it hard to get behind the nostalgia of 1989 TV, simply because what was happening with her at the time. Anyone else get what I mean? I probably am not explaining it well but basically I think the whole media frenzy and Taylor's image during 1989 era had me feeling a bit out of the loop with how so many have such positive nostalgia from it when mine..

I was baffled at how it wasn't released in an album like 1989 because it was so good when I first listened to it.,117,123,0.96,2023-08-09 03:44:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15m1a2a/best_vault_track/,GriffinTamer12,Discussion :taythink:
15rsikr,Unpopular opinion: I'd rather vault tracks not be collabs,"Before I get rocks thrown at me: some of Taylor's collabs are among my faves. Ok, make it mostly one collab, but she's in the highest rank: The Last Time with Gary Lightbody, from *Red*

Aside from these, while I have enjoyed some of the collabs, they tend to not really reach super fave status. I'm here for our queen: Just give me the queen!

My hope for the 5 vault tracks of *1989 (Taylor's Version)* is that none of them be collabs.",279,64,0.93,2023-08-15 15:18:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15rsikr/unpopular_opinion_id_rather_vault_tracks_not_be/,arianebx,Discussion :taythink:
15nsdo9,Vault Tracks: can someone ELI5??,So Taylor has indicated that for each of the re-released albums there were several vault tracks to choose from but she limited them. Why would she not release all of them?? It seems like it would benefit her to have all of them out? Do you think she will ever release all of the things in the vault? I‚Äôd love to discuss ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,18,26,0.92,2023-08-11 01:42:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15nsdo9/vault_tracks_can_someone_eli5/,FlannelIsTheColor,Discussion :taythink:
15nj250,Who are you going gets a feature on the 1989 vault tracks?,I‚Äôve seen a lot of people want Harry Styles to make a feature on the original Style track but I personally hope Taylor releases a version of that later on and keeps the original track the same. I‚Äôm honestly hoping Sabrina Carpenter or Lorde makes a feature.,6,9,0.8,2023-08-10 19:42:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/15nj250/who_are_you_going_gets_a_feature_on_the_1989/,Ecstatic_Taste3747,Discussion :taythink:

15om1d0,why are online sales now usually limited to the store's own country?,"hi yall! i wanted to raise this question cause i've been buying vinyls for sooo many years on different stores (i live in the EU so i usually get my vinyls from Germany or France, since I don't really have a very reliable store in my own country).. but now with Taylor's 1989 TV i'm reading a lot of ""Germany only"" ""Delivery to German address only"".. and that stuff.. i understand in the US they do this a lot in order to chart properly... but in Germany???? France???? who cares about charts?? is there any other reason... honestly, i've been doing it for so long and now all suddenly this is throwing me off...",0,5,0.5,2023-08-11 23:57:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/15om1d0/why_are_online_sales_now_usually_limited_to_the/,dowisiiito,[DISCUSSION]
